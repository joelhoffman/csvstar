csv-star is a faster tool designed as a drop-in replacement for the popular Python `csvkit` library.

## Installation

To compile and install csv-star, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd csvkit
cargo install --path .
```

The binaries will be available wherever cargo puts them (e.g. `~/.cargo/bin` if using rustup.) You can add it to your PATH for future usage.
